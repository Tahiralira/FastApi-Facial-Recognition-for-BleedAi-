# FastApi-Facial-Recognition-for-BleedAi-
A yet-to-be-completed Python application that combines  MediaPipe for facial detection and cropping with efficient user management capabilities. With features for creating, updating, and deleting user profiles, alongside advanced image processing functionalities.


Facial Recognition and User Management System
Overview
A Python application designed to do facial recognition tasks while offering a user management system. I used MediaPipe for facial detection and cropping, and combined it with a backend built on FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.

Features
Facial Recognition: Utilizes MediaPipe's FaceMesh model for accurate facial detection and landmark identification.
User Management: Offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user profiles efficiently.
Secure Authentication: Implements authorization middleware to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive endpoints.
Image Processing: Provides endpoints for processing images, including facial detection and cropping functionalities.
Caching: Implements caching mechanisms to optimize the performance of CRUD operations and image processing.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for developing the backend server and business logic.
FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
SQLAlchemy: An SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, used for database operations.
MediaPipe: A cross-platform, customizable ML solution for live and streaming media that powers the facial detection and cropping functionalities.
Cachetools: A collection of caching utilities for Python, used to optimize performance by caching database queries and image processing results.
Installation

'''bash
git clone https://github.com/Tahiralira/FastApi-Facial-Recognition-for-BleedAi-.git
'''
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the server:
